# back-end

Documentation is available [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10983804/SzfDxQYR?version=latest#2e416288-43ec-4dc1-a74a-53707cb3f2ae)

A live version of the API is available [here](https://api-silent-auction.herokuapp.com/)

In order to use this backend, clone this repo and run `npm install` on your local copy, then run `npm run server` to start up your local copy. In order to use auth, you need to set up a .env file with an `AUTH_SECRET` so the authorization middleware has something to hash with.
